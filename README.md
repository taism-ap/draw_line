# Python Draw Line
Introduction to basic computer graphics

## Drawing points
Open the draw_points.py file in your favourite IDE and make sure it works. Try changing the created pixel, try adding more pixels, go nuts.
If using repl.it, you will encounter an error akin to "no module named PIL". This can be fixed using the following steps:
1. click on "Packages" on the left - the cube that resembles a package
2. search for "pillow"
3. select Pillow v7.0.0 (not Pillow-PIL or any of the others that come up)
4. click the add symbol
5. re-run the code after pillow has been installed
